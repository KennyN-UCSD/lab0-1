## About Me (*very short version*)

Hi, my name is *Kenny Nguyen**.
I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student at the *University of California, San Diego*.
I am a **Chemistry** Major with a minor in **Computer Science**.

I am interested in analytical and computational chemistry.
I also enjoy doing small coding projects for fun.

## Me as a Programmer

### A short summary on me as a programmer

I like to program small-scale programs, but I am willing to work on any kind of project that seems interesting.
I am comfortable in programming in Java, but I have also used C, C++, and Python.
I have very basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
I am also quite comfortable with programming in a Windows, Mac, and Linux environment.

I don't have a lot of experience in developing programs for other people and working in a team so I am interested in developing these skills.
I believe that although I am not the strongest coder, I am very good at learning new concepts and can adapt quickly to situations.
I also enjoy throroughly documenting my projects and ensuring that my code is clean and accessible.

### The long story about my path to becoming a programmer

I first took interest in programming in elementary school with our school's 5th grade LEGO Mindstorms Robotics unit.
We programmed our robots to do various tasks such as travel around a planter box and move from point to point.
At the end of the unit, we had a race in which my partner and I placed second.
> ~I was a little bit salty over the fact that the first-place team's robot was built by one of their fathers, who was an engineer.~

At the same time, I started playing Minecraft and became very interested in redstone circuits.
Soon, I learned how to create servers to play with my friends and family.
I also began to create my own minigame maps and random creations using command blocks and later data packs.
I believe that the time I spent in Minecraft designing intricate systems for creating products that I was satisfied with really helped me develop my programming skills early.

However, I did not start coding actual programs until 10th grade of high school where I took an introductory Computer Science course that involved writing Visual Basic programs.
The next year, I took AP Computer Science where I became familiar with Java.
As I progressed through the class, I made my own programs and projects to help me out with some tedious tasks. I also learned other programming languages to help me develop some of these programs.

Some of these projects include:

- A Discord Bot
  - Ran server management commands
  - Played music
  - Played basic games and rolled dice
  - Displayed certain information, videos, and memes on demand
  - Brought up character stats and builds for certain video games
- A program to track Effort Values gained by Pokémon
- A program that calculated the materials needed to be farmed for equipment in certain games
- Small Minecraft Mods

Through these projects and Computer Science coursework, I became interested in not only creating programs, but also how computers and programs work on a deeper level.
As a result, I was torn between studying Chemistry or Computer Science in college.
In the end, I applied to have Computer Science as a minor in my second year at UCSD and have taken various courses that have developed my knowledge and introduced me to various tools that I use to develop my personal products.

In the future, I would be satisfied in having a career in either Chemistry or Computer Science, but my ultimate goal is to find work that bridges the two together. As such, I have taken interest in Computational Chemistry.

### Me as a person (*the longer version*)

I would say that I am reserved person, but willing to come out with the right people.
